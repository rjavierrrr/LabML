The project's virtual environment was successfully set up using Python, with all required dependencies documented in a requirements.txt file. The repository was initialized locally with Git and later connected to a remote repository on GitHub, where the main branch was created and pushed. A Pull Request was created, and Ignacio Cabrera reviewed the changes and successfully tested the project in his environment. The review confirmed that the project functions as expected, and any feedback provided was addressed before merging the changes into the main branch. This progress ensures a solid foundation for continued collaborative development and the implementation of new features.
